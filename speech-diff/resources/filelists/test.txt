/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/test/f2d/f2dafaff-f655-42d6-9d29-6cf242ec36cf.wav|right they don't time spend time jockeying for power but there's another reason as well and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan|230
/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/test/de1/de12b34d-0bcb-4bd3-9f61-a396c16681e5.wav|right and then they execute on it and then what happens is when they put the marshmallow on the top they run out of time and what happens it's a crisis|230

/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/test/8f9/8f97adb7-ca3b-4f84-9337-7f9f8a9dcb87.wav|always keeping the marshmallow on top so they have multiple times to to fix ill built prototypes along the way so designers recognize this type of collaboration|230

/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/test/111/11142886-6bc5-438f-b09f-d2d8acbc7a95.wav|so the average for most people is around twenty inches business schools students about half of that lawyers a little better but not much better than that kindergarteners better than most adults who does the very best|230
