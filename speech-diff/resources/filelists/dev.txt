/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/dev/ec2/ec268185-2af2-4d5a-9457-35c5b0d4be07.wav|most importantly they're physical so like the blocks you can move them just by reaching out and grasping and siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information|666

/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/dev/137/137f169b-5445-425d-a147-fad74d3adeeb.wav|i can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo to one one way or the other|666

/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/dev/357/357a872f-f1aa-4a5f-af83-979cef44ce81.wav|i can rearrange the sequence while it plays i don't have to plan it out in advance but i can improvise changing it making it longer or shorter as i go|666
/store/store4/data/TEDLIUM_release1/tedlium/wavs/dev/0df/0dfa8d28-7fcf-4762-baac-ef06684fdeba.wav|and now finally i can fade the whole sequence out using the volume siftable tilted to the left|666
